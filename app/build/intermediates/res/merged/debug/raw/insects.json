    "insectName": "Common Stalk Borer",
    "insectDesc": "Larvae have white and purple-brown stripes that turn mostly white when they are fully mature. Fully- grown larvae are about 1.5 inches long.",
    "insectTime": "An uncommon sweet corn pest. This pest is associated with grassy weeds and giant ragweed. Herbicide applications often trigger larvae to move from grasses and other weeds to sweet corn. ",
    "insectSampling": "From emergence through 6-leaf stage, check 100 plants in three locations per field for stalk injury and larvae. Scout weekly or more often if burn-down herbicides kill weeds and trigger larvae to move to corn. ",
    "insectThreshold": "Treatment is justified if small larvae cause 3 percent stand loss, or if large larvae cause 5 percent stand loss. ",
    "insectManagement": "Good grass control prior to planting will reduce stalk borer incidence. ",
